# Dreaming Spanish Enhanced

## Enhancements

### Progress Page

1. Instead of just showing how many days you have until your next level, it now shows the expected date too.
2. It shows how many days you have until the next level and expected date based on your overall daily average and your monthly average.

## TODO/Bugs

### Progress Page

1. Update the monthly progress to be based on current displayed month (probably need to attach a click handler to the calendar)
2. When the page changes view (mobile <-> desktop), the additional info vanishes until the page is refreshed.

### Video page

1. Is it possible to display difficulty without sorting by easy/hard?

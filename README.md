# Dreaming Spanish Enhanced

TamperMonkey scripts to enhance your Dreaming Spanish experience.

## Enhancements

### Progress Page

1. Instead of just showing how many days you have until your next level, it now shows the expected date too.
2. It shows how many days you have until the next level and expected date based on your overall daily average and the monthly average of the displayed month in the Calendar.

## Installation

1. Install TamperMonkey (or similar extension of your choice) for your browser.
2. If this is your first time installing this script, click on TamperMonkey and click "Create a new script".
3. If you have installed this script before, to update the script, click on TamperMonkey. Then, click on "Dashboard." Find the script that says "Dreaming Spanish Enhanced" and click on the edit button under Actions.
4. Copy-and-paste the [contents of progress.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/about-programmer/dreaming-spanish-enhanced/main/progress.js)
5. Click File > Save (or ctrl + s). Your script should be installed now.
6. Verify the installation, by going to the [Dreaming Spanish progress page](https://www.dreamingspanish.com/progress). You should see additional information on this page. See the Enhancements heading to see what you should expect.

## Bugs

### Progress Page

1. There's an intermittent issue where the data might not show up on Firefox until you refresh the page or change the calendar.
2. When the page changes view (mobile <-> desktop), the additional info vanishes until the page is refreshed or you change the calendar.

## TODO

### Video page

1. Is it possible to display difficulty without sorting by easy/hard? I have the forumla, but how hard would be it to actually get and display that data.
